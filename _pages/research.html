<p><strong>Growth at the Margin: Political Incentives and Firm Behavior in China</strong><br>
Sole author, September 2025<br>
<strong><em>Abstract:</em></strong> This paper examines how China’s annual GDP growth targets—an essential feature of its economic governance—shape incentives for city leaders and influence firm-level output and resource allocation. Using survival models, bunching analysis, and a threshold-based strategy, I find that a one-unit increase in a city leader’s performance score—defined as the gap between actual and target GDP growth—raises the probability of promotion by 9–10%. The analysis also reveals a significant clustering of performance scores just above the growth threshold, with observations at that margin occurring 1.5 to 2 times more frequently than would be expected in the absence of such incentives. At the firm level, politically driven pressures produce positive discontinuities in GDP-related indicators, such as inventory accumulation, sales and output. This effect is more pronounced when cities are close to meeting their annual targets or face heightened pressure due to underperformance in the earlier quarters of the year. Using detailed firm-level data on energy consumption and pollution emissions as proxies for real output, the evidence suggests that much of the observed firm-level discontinuity reflects actual economic activity, not just statistical manipulation. These findings suggest that growth incentives alter firm-level output and resource allocation through politically motivated production responses.<br>

<p><strong>Digital Revitalization or Useless Effort: The Impact of a Government-initiated E-commerce Platform on Local Specialty Sales</strong><br>
With Xintong Han, Jan Victor Dee, and Shaojia Wang (Revise & Resubmit at <strong><em>Journal of Development Economics</em></strong>)<br>
<strong><em>Abstract:</em></strong> This empirical study examines the impact of a Government-initiated E-commerce Platform (GEP) on local specialty sales, focusing on China’s Pu’er tea market. Two-way fixed effects regressions were employed on data from 983 farmers, representing over more than 95% of local tea farming output over a five-year period. The results indicate that the launch of the GEP resulted in a 15.55% decrease in offline sales and a 16.65% increase in online sales. Further evidence suggests that the increase in online sales was primarily due to an expansion in product assortment, rather than an increase in the number of online sellers.<br>

  <li>Market Access and Land Finance: The Growth of China's High-Speed Rail Expansion<br></li>
  <strong><em>Abstract:</em></strong> This project investigates the interaction between China’s infrastructure expansion, local fiscal incentives, and land markets. To meet short-term growth targets, local governments rely heavily on land-based financing—leasing state-owned land to generate budgetary revenues. I examine whether the rapid expansion of high-speed rail (HSR)—a hallmark of China’s infrastructure-led growth—affects local land markets by improving market access and increasing land values. Using a newly compiled dataset of over 1.7 million land transactions from 2000–2023, I construct GDP-weighted market access indices at the county level, accounting for the minimum travel time across four transport modes (HSR, conventional rail, motorways, and waterways). Preliminary results show that increases in market access are strongly associated with higher unit prices of land transfers, suggesting that HSR expansion indirectly enhances local governments’ fiscal capacity. In ongoing work, I leverage the geographic coordinates of land parcels and HSR stations to directly measure spatial proximity and quantify the localized effects of station openings on land prices. This setting provides a new lens to assess whether China’s infrastructure investment not only reduces trade costs but also operates as an instrument for political incentives, by boosting land revenues and facilitating the achievement of growth targets.<br>
