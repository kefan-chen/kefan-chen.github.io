<p><strong>Growth at the Margin: Political Incentives and Firm Behavior in China</strong><br>
Sole author, September 2025<br>
<strong><em>Abstract:</em></strong> This paper examines how China’s annual GDP growth targets—an essential feature of its economic governance—shape incentives for city leaders and influence firm-level output and resource allocation. Using survival models, bunching analysis, and a threshold-based strategy, I find that a one-unit increase in a city leader’s performance score—defined as the gap between actual and target GDP growth—raises the probability of promotion by 9–10%. The analysis also reveals a significant clustering of performance scores just above the growth threshold, with observations at that margin occurring 1.5 to 2 times more frequently than would be expected in the absence of such incentives. At the firm level, politically driven pressures produce positive discontinuities in GDP-related indicators, such as inventory accumulation, sales and output. This effect is more pronounced when cities are close to meeting their annual targets or face heightened pressure due to underperformance in the earlier quarters of the year. Using detailed firm-level data on energy consumption and pollution emissions as proxies for real output, the evidence suggests that much of the observed firm-level discontinuity reflects actual economic activity, not just statistical manipulation. These findings suggest that growth incentives alter firm-level output and resource allocation through politically motivated production responses.<br>
