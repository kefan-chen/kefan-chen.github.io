<p><strong>Growth at the Margin: Political Incentives and Firm Behavior in China</strong><br>
Sole author, September 2025<br>
This paper examines how China’s annual GDP growth targets—an essential feature of its economic governance—shape incentives for city leaders and influence firm-level output and resource allocation.

The analysis reveals a significant clustering of performance scores just above the growth threshold, and at the firm level, GDP-related indicators show discontinuities that reflect real production responses.<br>
