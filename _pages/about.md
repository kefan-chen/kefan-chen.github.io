I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at McGill University. I will be entering the job market in the 2025â€“2026 academic year. My research interests lie at the intersection of development economics, political economy, and labor economics. You can find my CV [here](/cv/).

## Research Topics

- Bureaucratic incentives and economic distortions
